UnivUnix Docpad for Raspberry Pi and non Raspi servers.

This is an optimized version of UnivUnix (http://www.unviunix.com) for Raspberry Pi used as server.

*Why is optimized for Raspberry Pi?*

Because the original version of this web is made using Wordpress CMS. Wordpress needs a database engine to work, but Raspberry Pi doesn't have so much RAM memory. Using docpad as main cms, a database engine isn't needed.
